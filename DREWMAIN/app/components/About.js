      <p>We are students at General Assembly, studying web development. We wanted to create an app specifically for brunch in different neighborhoods in manhattan. Figuring out a great brunch place is always difficult so we wanted to make searching for brunch an easier process. Neighborhood search and filters should give the user a good understanding of the type of brunch restaurants are offering. Enjoy!</p>
